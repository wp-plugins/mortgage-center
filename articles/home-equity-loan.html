Home Equity Loans
<div>
	<p>
		Need to remodel but no money? Or need a loan to send Johnny to college? You can
		tap into the equity you have in your home (the amount your house is worth minus
		what you owe on it) via a Home Equity Line of Credit, or Home Equity Loan.</p>

				Home Equity Loans are when a lender gives you a set amount of money and you pay
				it back over a fixed payment schedule. Typically these loans have fixed interest
				rates. This is a better option for someone who wants to lock in a fixed interest
				rate, either because they think interest rates are going to increase or because
				they like the certainty of knowing what their payment schedule will be.</p>
			<p>
				A home equity loan also is a better option than a home equity line if you know exactly
				how much money you need to borrow and when you want to borrow it.</p>

				Home Equity Line of Credit
			</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				A HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit, is the right to borrow up to a certain amount
				of money from a lender. The "line" is a credit line guaranteed by your house, meaning
				that if you can't live up to the terms of the line, then the lender has a right
				(after a few nasty letters) to foreclose on your house. Typically, HELOCs (pronounced
				HEE-locks) have floating interest rates that can change periodically.</p>
			<p>
				For example, a borrower might obtain a $75,000 HELOC at "prime plus one." This means
				that the interest rate is one percentage point higher than the Prime Rate. If Prime
				is 5.5%, then the HELOC is 6.5%. Remember: The rate is tied to the Prime and could
				change as much as at every billing date. (The change can be dramatic; e.g., in April
				of 2007, the Prime was 8.25 percent, whereas in June of 2003, it was 4.25 percent.)</p>
			<p>
				Home equity lines can be used by the borrower to pay for anything. You literally
				get a checkbook for the HELOC and you can write checks to your heart's content until
				you've maxed out the line's limit. Although HELOCs were originally designed for
				homeowners to pay for home improvements and other house-related projects, nowadays
				borrowers use home equity lines for almost anything. Most HELOCs also have online
				Internet access so you can pay bills online using your HELOC just like you would
				with a regular online checking account. Like a credit card balance, you can pay
				down a HELOC at any time, without penalties.</p>
			<p>
				Home equity lines are serious stuff, since they're secured by your house. If you
				can't meet the payment obligations such as your minimum monthly balance, your homeownership
				is in jeopardy.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who should get one: Someone who might need extra cash for home improvements, or
					is looking at borrowing money to buy a different house (in addition to a mortgage).</li>
				<li>Who shouldn't: Do not use a HELOC to splurge for things like vacations or to finance
					other consumer debts, like credit card purchases (unless you then plan to tear those
					cards up!). HELOCs are guaranteed by your house, which means the stakes are very
					high.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>
				Home Equity Tax and Interest Information
			</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Are HELOCs tax deductible? Sort of. Like first mortgage interest payments, home-equity
				borrowing differs from credit card debt in that you can deduct the interest on your
				tax return. But this only applies if you itemize your deductions. Also, the tax
				deduction on interest is limited to loan amounts up to $100,000, with some restrictions.</p>
			<p>
				What determines the interest rate? The <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Glossary.htm">
					Loan to Value</a> and your <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Credit-Scores.htm">credit
						score</a> determine the interest rate of a home equity loan or line. If
				your credit score is excellent (760+), you may be able to get an interest rate at
				the prime lending rate, or possibly lower. A good credit score (700-760) will likely
				get you an interest rate that is about the same as the prime rate. Poor credit will
				likely result in rates of 1-5 points higher than the prime rate. Except in some
				cases, you should be able to avoid fees such as application or appraisal fees, though
				you might get hit with an annual fee or a small "recording" fee.</p>

			<h2>
				Home Equity Loan as a Second Mortgage
			</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				HELOCs and home equity loans can also be used as second mortgages at the time of
				purchase. Frequently they are the second purchase mortgage for 10, 15, or 20 percent
				of the purchase price when buying a home. Home buyers can avoid buying <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Private-Mortgage-Insurance.htm">
					mortgage insurance (PMI)</a> if they take out two loans instead of one, with
				no single loan exceeding 80 percent of the purchase price. Home equity loans (or
				lines) can fill this gap, wherein the first mortgage is frequently 80 percent of
				the purchase price and the Home Equity Loan is the second mortgage.</p>
