Private Mortgage Insurance: How it Affects a Mortgage
<p>
	If you are making a down payment of less than 20 percent, you will most likely have
	to get <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Private-Mortgage-Insurance.htm">Private Mortgage Insurance</a>
	(or PMI). It ensures that the lender is guaranteed, by the mortgage insurer, 80
	percent of the loan if you default. The insurance premium amount varies by the <a
		href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Glossary.htm">loan-to-value</a> of the house and
	type of loan. But generally, the initial premium is 1-5% of the mortgage total,
	and possibly an additional monthly fee.</p>
<p>
	Not all lenders will require PMI, but those that follow the <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com">
		Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> guidelines
	will.</p>
<p>
	Some borrows opt to get a second mortgage to use for part of the down payment to
	avoid paying PMI. For example, you can get an 80/10/10 loan (80 percent loan, 10
	percent second mortgage, and 10 percent down) or a variation thereof and sidestep
	PMI.</p>
<p>
	Government loan programs, such as <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Types-Of-Mortgages-And-Home-Loans.htm">
		FHA or VA loans</a>, are backed by the government rather than PMI.</p>
