What to Ask Mortgage Lenders
<p>
	When you ask the questions below, listen carefully to see if the lender is answering
	in a straightforward way, without using jargon you don't understand. When you ask
	about fees, do they include them all voluntarily? If you think they are trying too
	hard to push you in a certain direction, go elsewhere.
