            Need to remodel but no money? Or need a loan to send Johnny to college? You can
            tap into the equity you have in your home (the amount your house is worth minus
            what you owe on it) via a Home Equity Line of Credit, or Home Equity Loan.</p>

                    Home Equity Loans are when a lender gives you a set amount of money and you pay
                    it back over a fixed payment schedule. Typically these loans have fixed interest
                    rates. This is a better option for someone who wants to lock in a fixed interest
                    rate, either because they think interest rates are going to increase or because
                    they like the certainty of knowing what their payment schedule will be.</p>
                <p>
                    A home equity loan also is a better option than a home equity line if you know exactly
                    how much money you need to borrow and when you want to borrow it.</p>

                    A HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit, is the right to borrow up to a certain amount
                    of money from a lender. The "line" is a credit line guaranteed by your house, meaning
                    that if you can't live up to the terms of the line, then the lender has a right
                    (after a few nasty letters) to foreclose on your house. Typically, HELOCs (pronounced
                    HEE-locks) have floating interest rates that can change periodically.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, a borrower might obtain a $75,000 HELOC at "prime plus one." This means
                    that the interest rate is one percentage point higher than the Prime Rate. If Prime
                    is 5.5%, then the HELOC is 6.5%. Remember: The rate is tied to the Prime and could
                    change as much as at every billing date. (The change can be dramatic; e.g., in April
                    of 2007, the Prime was 8.25 percent, whereas in June of 2003, it was 4.25 percent.)</p>
                <p>
                    Home equity lines can be used by the borrower to pay for anything. You literally
                    get a checkbook for the HELOC and you can write checks to your heart's content until
                    you've maxed out the line's limit. Although HELOCs were originally designed for
                    homeowners to pay for home improvements and other house-related projects, nowadays
                    borrowers use home equity lines for almost anything. Most HELOCs also have online
                    Internet access so you can pay bills online using your HELOC just like you would
                    with a regular online checking account. Like a credit card balance, you can pay
                    down a HELOC at any time, without penalties.</p>
                <p>
                    Home equity lines are serious stuff, since they're secured by your house. If you
                    can't meet the payment obligations such as your minimum monthly balance, your homeownership
                    is in jeopardy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who should get one: Someone who might need extra cash for home improvements, or
                        is looking at borrowing money to buy a different house (in addition to a mortgage).</li>
                    <li>Who shouldn't: Do not use a HELOC to splurge for things like vacations or to finance
                        other consumer debts, like credit card purchases (unless you then plan to tear those
                        cards up!). HELOCs are guaranteed by your house, which means the stakes are very
                        high.</li>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Are HELOCs tax deductible? Sort of. Like first mortgage interest payments, home-equity
                    borrowing differs from credit card debt in that you can deduct the interest on your
                    tax return. But this only applies if you itemize your deductions. Also, the tax
                    deduction on interest is limited to loan amounts up to $100,000, with some restrictions.</p>
                <p>
                    What determines the interest rate? The <a href="/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Glossary.htm">
                        Loan to Value</a> and your <a href="/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Credit-Scores.htm">credit
                            score</a> determine the interest rate of a home equity loan or line. If
                    your credit score is excellent (760+), you may be able to get an interest rate at
                    the prime lending rate, or possibly lower. A good credit score (700-760) will likely
                    get you an interest rate that is about the same as the prime rate. Poor credit will
                    likely result in rates of 1-5 points higher than the prime rate. Except in some
                    cases, you should be able to avoid fees such as application or appraisal fees, though
                    you might get hit with an annual fee or a small "recording" fee.</p>

                    Home Equity Loan as a Second Mortgage

            <div>
                <p>
                    HELOCs and home equity loans can also be used as second mortgages at the time of
                    purchase. Frequently they are the second purchase mortgage for 10, 15, or 20 percent
                    of the purchase price when buying a home. Home buyers can avoid buying <a href="/mortgage/help/Private-Mortgage-Insurance.htm">
                        mortgage insurance (PMI)</a> if they take out two loans instead of one, with
                    no single loan exceeding 80 percent of the purchase price. Home equity loans (or
                    lines) can fill this gap, wherein the first mortgage is frequently 80 percent of
                    the purchase price and the Home Equity Loan is the second mortgage.</p>
