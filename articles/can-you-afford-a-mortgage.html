Can You Afford a Mortgage?
<p>
	Whether you're a first-time buyer looking for the perfect starter house, or a seasoned
	pro trading up to your waterfront dream home, you are probably asking the same questions:
	Can I afford this? And is this the <i>right</i> move at the <i>right</i> time?</p>
<p>
	Of course, you can use a mortgage calculator and ask the experts — lenders, agents,
	and mom — but the reality is that you are the only one who truly knows whether you
	can afford to buy right now. And, painful as it is, what you need to start with
	is a detailed expense breakdown. Analyze what you spend — at least get a full month's
	snapshot. You'll see where you may have wiggle room in your budget and what you
	can afford for housing. (Be sure to count all those little incidental expenses like
	dry cleaning and yes, those mid-afternoon Starbucks lattes count in the budget,
	too!)</p>
<h2>
	Sample Budget</h2>
<p>
	This sample budget belongs to a single, 35-year-old woman making $68,000 per year,
	renting a two-bedroom apartment. Her monthly pre-tax income is $5,667.</p>

	The sample budget may not look like your expense snapshot, but by adding and subtracting
	your personal budget items with an eye toward true monthly out-of-pocket totals,
	you get a pretty good picture. Now, add in all of the expenses where the zeros are
	as well as the increased cost of your monthly mortgage payment (formerly rent).
	Maintenance costs like condo fees, utilities, the leaky bathroom sink that defies
	a simple trip to Home Depot to fix, property taxes, <a href="/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Fees-And-Closing-Costs.htm">
		closing costs</a>, and furniture for your new home all add to the bottom line.</p>
<h2>
	Debt-to-Income Ratios</h2>
<p>
	If you figure out that you can afford your projected budget, chances are you'll
	qualify for a mortgage in your range. Lenders will determine how much loan you can
	afford by using something called your debt-to-income ratio, which is the ratio of
	a borrower's total debt as a percentage of their total gross income. Basically,
	they will look at what's left in your budget after your monthly bills are paid.
	These include credit card payments, car payments, child support, etc.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Housing ratio (or "front-end ratio")</strong>: Lenders want your total mortgage
		debt (called PITI — an acronym for Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance) and
		condo fees to be no more than 30 percent of your gross monthly income; 28 percent
		is standard.</li>
	<li><strong>Overall debt ratio (or "back-end ratio")</strong>: These are revolving monthly
		payments, such as credit card, car lease, or loan payments, student loans, child
		support, alimony, monthly utilities. (They do not include those lattes, but you
		might want to plug in your lifestyle expenses for your own sake.) The ratio should
		not be more than 36 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Debt-to-income ratio standards differ from lender to lender, and vary based on your
	loan program, but most lenders will give more weight to your <a href="/mortgage/help/How-Credit-Reports-Affect-Mortgage.htm">
		credit history</a> as a factor in determining your particular situation. Here
	is a typical ratio for a first-time buyer:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Monthly gross household income:</dt>
	<dd>
		$5,700</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage debt ratio:</dt>
	<dd>
		28% $1,596.0</dd>
	<dt>Expenses and overall debt:</dt>
	<dd>
		36% $2,052.0
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	The mortgage debt of $1,596 is right in line with the current monthly rent payment
	in the example above. As long as the monthly debt obligations and household expenses
	are no higher than $2,000-2,300, this borrower should have no problem qualifying.</p>
<p>
	If your credit is stellar, you will be rewarded. Lenders may stretch these ratios
	to 38/45, allowing you to purchase more home and take advantage of more lending
	programs. And if you are a first-time home-buyer applying for an <a href="/mortgage/help/Types-Of-Mortgages-And-Home-Loans.htm">
		FHA or VA loan</a>, you may also be able to qualify with a higher back-end ratio
	— up to 41 percent of your monthly gross income — and get approved for these federally-insured
	loans.</p>
<h2>
	How It Works</h2>
<p>
	So, back to the question: How much home can I afford?</p>
<p>
	Keeping in mind the variables on debt-to-income ratios and the many lending programs
	available, here is a sample breakdown for a mid-range home.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Monthly gross household income (pre-tax):</dt>
	<dd>
		$7,000</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage debt ratio</dt>
	<dd>
		28% $1,960
	</dd>
	<dt>Home price</dt>
	<dd>
		$350,000</dd>
	<dt>20% down payment</dt>
	<dd>
		$70,000</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage</dt>
	<dd>
		$280,000</dd>
	<dt>Interest rate on 30-year mortgage</dt>
	<dd>
		6.33%</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage payment (principle and interest)</dt>
	<dd>
		$1,739</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Here is an example of a lower price-range home, purchased with the same loan terms
	and interest rate:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Monthly gross household income (pre-tax):</dt>
	<dd>
		$3,600</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage debt ratio</dt>
	<dd>
		28% $1,008</dd>
	<dt>Home price</dt>
	<dd>
		150,000</dd>
	<dt>10% down payment</dt>
	<dd>
		15,000</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage</dt>
	<dd>
		135,000</dd>
	<dt>Interest rate on 30-year mortgage</dt>
	<dd>
		6.33%</dd>
	<dt>Mortgage payment (P&I)</dt>
	<dd>
		$838</dd>
</dl>
<h2>
	And the Other Costs...</h2>
<p>
	In addition to the monthly mortgage payment, remember to factor in the added costs
	of home purchase and ownership. Since this buyer above did not put 20 percent down,
	he will need to add mortgage insurance, also known as PMI, to his monthly payment.
	PMI protects lenders against losses that can occur when a borrower defaults on a
	loan, and is required for borrowers with a down payment of less than 20 percent
	of the purchase price. Buyers also incur <a href="/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Fees-And-Closing-Costs.htm">
		closing costs</a> of 2.5 to 3 percent of the total loan amount. This covers
	the cost of title searches, appraisals, legal fees, etc.</p>
<p>
	So what's left to apply to the down payment? Using the example above, our first-time
	buyer has $15,000 for the down payment on a $150,000 home, and the closing costs
	may come to $4,500. The mortgage total just increased to $139,500. Over the 30-year
	loan period, this brings the mortgage payment to approximately $866 per month. If
	your head is not already spinning, now tack on mortgage insurance (fees vary based
	on the loan), homeowners' taxes and condo fees (if applicable), bringing the total
	monthly payment to approximately $1,038. The good news is this is still well in
	the range of the acceptable debt ratio.</p>
<h2>
	Keep Some Money in Reserve</h2>
<p>
	Many buyers invest every red cent they have into their new purchase, but it's a
	good idea to keep some emergency cash, or "leaky faucet money," aside in the event
	of emergency repairs or a job loss. So don't completely raid your savings; with
	home ownership, expect the unexpected.</p>
