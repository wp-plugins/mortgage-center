Mortgage Refinancing

		<h5>
			Do you Qualify for a "Making Home Affordable" Refinance?
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			The government's Making Home Affordable initiative is designed to help millions
			of homeowners stay in their homes through refinanced mortgages or <a href="http://www.zillow.com/loan-modification/">
				loan modifications</a>.</p>
		<p>
			To qualify, you must:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Own-occupy a one-to four-unit home.</strong> This plan only applies to those
				who own and occupy a property that is a single-family home, condo, duplex, triplex,
				or four-unit house. </li>
			<li><strong>Be current on your mortgage payments.</strong> If you were late on your
				mortgage payment by more than 30 days or missed a payment entirely in the past 12
				months, you do not qualify. This requirement to be current is to show you can make
				payments.</li>
			<li><strong>Owe between 80-125% of your mortgage.</strong> An analysis of <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/national-market-continues-to-drop-some-markets-showing-first-signs-of-slowing-decline/2009/05/05/">
				Zillow Q1 Real Estate Market Reports</a> shows that up to 36% of all homeowners
				with mortgages, or 20.1 million households, could now potentially qualify for the
				plan.</li>
			<li><strong>Have a loan backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</strong> Approximately
				60% of single-family loans are backed by Fannie or Freddie, but a homeowner may
				not know this about their own loan. If you don't know, call Fannie at 1-800-7FANNIE
				and Freddie at 1-800-FREDDIE or submit online forms with <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/homepath/homeaffordable.jhtml">
					Fannie</a> and <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/corporate/buyown/english/avoiding_foreclosure/avoiding_foreclosure_form.html">
						Freddie</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Have a conforming loan.</strong> That means a <a href="https://www.efanniemae.com/sf/refmaterials/loanlimits/index.jsp">
				loan under $417,000</a> in many areas or up to $625,500 in high-cost areas like
				San Francisco, Boston or Washington, DC. Even still, the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/WhatsaZindex.htm">
					Zillow Home Value Index</a> (median home value) for the city of San Francisco
				is $724,244, which says that lots of people have loans higher than the conforming
				limit. (Note: the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/conforming-loan-limits-for-mortgages-return-to-729750/2009/02/">
					conforming loan limit for certain high-cost areas of the U.S. for 2009 mortgage
					originations is now $729,500.</a>)</li>
			<li>Take this <a href="http://www.financialstability.gov/makinghomeaffordable/refinance_eligibility.html">
				financialstability.gov Q&A</a> to see if you qualify. If you don't think you qualify
				for a refinance, you might qualify for a loan modification under the plan.</li>

			Mortgage Refinance Overview
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			You have an <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Types-Of-Mortgages-And-Home-Loans.htm">Adjustable
				Rate Mortgage (ARM)</a> which was doing fine enough that you bragged about it
			but your loan is going to reset to a higher interest rate amidst market uncertainty
			and everyone is buzzing about it. Lying awake at night is interfering with your
			job, so you figure you'd better say goodbye to that low but fluctuating interest
			rate, and get a nice secure fixed-rate loan before the swing hits the sky.</p>
		<p>
			This is a common scenario these days as interest rates inch up and many homeowners
			who opted for ARMs in the past 10 years are hoping to switch to a traditional loan.</p>
		<p>
			Switching types of mortgages, as described above, is one reason people refinance,
			which is simply replacing a current mortgage with another. But there are others.</p>

		<h2>
			Reasons for Home Refinancing
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Lower your interest, but keep your term: When rates drop you want to take advantage
				of it and lower your monthly payments, but keep the length of your mortgage.</li>
			<li>Take care of that balloon payment: You opted for a short-term ARM with a balloon
				payment and the due date is looming, so you have to come up with a longer-term loan.</li>
			<li>Shorten your term: Lower interest rates (or an increase in your income) mean you
				can pay down your principal faster.</li>
			<li>Credit rating change: Take advantage of an improved credit rating and get out from
				under that high rate you had to accept when you bought.</li>
			<li>You need cash: In some cases, you can refinance for an amount more than what you
				still owe on your home. Lenders limit the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/mortgage/help/Mortgage-Glossary.htm">
					Loan to Value</a> at no higher than 70 percent for this type of loan.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			Costs of Refinancing
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			Most of the things fees, appraisals, title insurance that went along with an original
			mortgage hold true for a refi, which means it can cost a fair amount to change loan
			types. How quickly you recoup the cost depends partially on how long you are going
			to keep the mortgage. If you are going to be in your home long enough to recover
			the costs, and get some benefit from lower interest payments over the life of the
			loan, then it's a no-brainer. But balancing the cost with the benefits of a new
			mortgage is critical. Use an online calculator to figure it out.</p>
		<p>
			Be sure to remember that closing costs include another appraisal (no matter how
			recently you've had one), a new credit report, underwriting fees, title insurance,
			escrow fee, recording fees, and perhaps other small fees. These costs typically
			range from $1500-$2000. (Some lenders are willing to waive the closing costs for
			a higher interest rate loan.)</p>

<div>
	<div>
		<h2>
			Can You Pay Points on a Home Refinance?
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			You can pay points on a refinance loan, same as on an original mortgage, but unlike
			with the original mortgage, the points are tax deductible over the entire term of
			the loan rather than just in the first year. Points make sense when rates are on
			the upswing and you want to get in on the lowest possible rate.</p>
		<p>
			But, except in some cases, points are a fact of life: if you are paying a 1-point
			fee on a $100,000 refi, you can add $1000 to your closing costs.</p>
		<p>
			You also need to look at your current mortgage to see if there are pre-payment penalties.
			And what happens to your old mortgage? It's paid off by the new loan, as are any
			other liens; at the end of the refinance process, ideally you should have only one
			loan. (If you have more than one mortgage, however, it's possible to refinance just
			one of the loans if the lender agrees.)</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>
			When Does Home Refinancing Make Sense?
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			The easy way to figure out if refinancing makes sense is to figure out how long
			it will take you to pay off the closing costs with the savings you realize with
			lower monthly payments. If it is longer than the time you plan to stay in the house,
			then refinancing might be a good option. You have fewer tax breaks with a lower-rate
			refi, so be sure to ask your lender for a refinance break-even table that will take
			that into account.</p>
